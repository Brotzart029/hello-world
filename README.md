# hello-world
I'm a noob trying to learn how to program
My name is Dakota, I work at ProValue.Net in Stillwater, OK and I am interested in learning how to program. I went to school for IT for 2 years and this peaked my interest in Cyber Security. I have not had many options to learn about Cyber-Security because it is not something that I went to school for. I am taking it upon myself to learn and become proficient in programming and IT fundamentals to land my dream job.
